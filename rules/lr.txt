    No delimiter, instead tab is a line separator
    One line comments = __ (double underscore)
    Multi-line comments = !@ <comment> @!
    Data type casting = <datatype in all caps> <variable> e.g. FPN number (sets num var to fpn var)
    Add kinetype = .<name of kinetype> <variable> e.g. -> .cannil string (adds cannil ktype to sc var)

    Data types:
        Normal types:
            Any = val -> { val value = "string" }
            Dynamic Tree = tree -> { tree AI } (starts a self-learning tree)
            Ambiguous (can change data type) = ambiguous -> { ambiguous }
            Array = arr -> { arr array = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] } (can be a vect or collection)
                Vector (same data type the entirety of the vector) = vect -> { vect-char characterVector = ['A' 'B' 'C'] }
                Collection (can be any data type for each element) = coll -> { coll collect = [3 "four" true nil] }

                And Parameters (checking if multiple values or types match a value of some sort) = anp (pronounced 'ap') -> {  }
                JSON (using json format) = json -> { json JSON = [{"some":"example"}, {"J":"S"}, {"O":"N"}] }

            Boolean = bool -> { bool boolean = true }
            Null = nil -> { nil-sc nullString }
            Exception = exc ->  { exc somethingElse = Except:(exc:type exceptionType, sc message) }

                Input Stream = in -> { in-sc,int input = "Enter your name and age: " }
            Global = glob -> { glob object = Resource } (anything can be accessed with glob (basically a reference of bytl itself))
            Procedure (a list of actions to run) = proc -> { proc procedure ("a procedure") }
                Algorithm = alg (returns a value) -> { alg-int algorithm <int arg1, int arg2> = (rn args_sum) }
                Function = fnc (doesn't return a value) -> { fnc function <int arg1, int arg2> = (.RAW "<arg1> and <arg2>") }
            Association = assoc -> { assoc<sc @sc sc> association = <"key1" "value1" "extra1", "key2" "value2" extra2"> } (the @ symbol means that that part of the association is how to access the part e.g. association("value1") will return ["key1" "value1" "extra1"])
            Regular Expression = rgx -> { rgx oneOrMoreDigit = ;r \d+ ;g }
            Modifier = mod (creates or selects a modifier) -> { mod SOMETHING .. rel ~targets (<proc procedure>) } (now {{ SOMETHING }} can now be used on whatever dtypes were specified)
            Time = time -> { int today = time_now_@day }
            Random = rnd -> { int rand = Rnd 1, 1 }
            Math = math -> { dec pi = math#PI }
            Neural Network = neurlw -> { neurlw }
            Code Macro = cmacro -> { cmacro macro = ( else (!@ code @!) ) } (everytime 'macro' is called, it will replace it with the code specified)

        Kinetic types (kinetypes can be chained by separating them with a period):
            Functional Kinetypes (fnktypes are ktypes with arguments using curly braces):
                Base = base (a variable's value based on another) -> { int.base{original} baser = 5 } (now every value 'original' increases, 'baser' will too i.e. if 'original++' is called, then 'baser++' is also called and therefore its value will become 6)
                Initial = init -> { int.init{20} initial = 7 } (now every time 'initial' becomes 20, it will revert back to 7)
                Lambda (only for procedure dtypes) = lambda -> { alg.lambda{$ + 2} lambdaFunc } (now any input to 'lambdaFunc' will return an addition of 2)
                Multi-Dimensional = md -> { vect.md{int.usn nestedLimit} twoDArray = [3 3 [5 5] 4 4 [6 6]] }
                Toggle = tog -> { int.tog{arr[dtype](Dtype #)} integerToggle } ()
                Left-hand side = lhs (only for proc dtypes) -> { proc.lhs{int sc} p = ( >> Args#lhs ) \\ 4 "4" p __ [4 "4"] }
            Valued Kinetypes (vlktypes are normal ktypes):
                Dynamic = dync -> { sc.dync dynamicVariable = "ooooooo" } (allows variable names to be dynamic)
                Object (accesses the constructor procedure of used datatype (every datatype except for dtype has its own constructor)) = obj -> { int.obj numberConstructor = Int 5 }
                Unit of Measurement = uom -> { int.uom newMeter = ;<-meter * 100 } (the semi-colon defines the context of the assignment)
                Nullable = cannil -> { sc.cannil string = nil }
                Instance = instance -> { vect.instance revCopy = array_rev } (instead of changing the value of array to a reversed state, it creates a new instance of it and sets that instance to the variable 'revCopy')
                Unique = uniq (only applies to arrays) -> { vect.uniq unique = [1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4] } ('unique' is equal to [1 2 3 4])
                Constant (Immutable) = immute -> { int.immute = 45 }
                Overloadable = ovld (only for procedure dtypes) -> { proc.ovld-int <int p> p = (rn p)   p <sc s> = (rn s) }
                Kinetic Type = ktype -> { book.ktype pages .. rn pages } (the dollar sign references the custom data type's property; the super type returns an algorithm (which is why 'rn' is used))
                Unsigned = usn (only for number dtypes) -> { int.usn unsigned = 34 }
                Signed = sn (only for number dtypes) -> { int.sn signed = -45 }
                Template Literal (only for sc dtypes) = raw -> { sc.raw templateLiteral = "this is a <thing>" } (anything inside the angle brackets runs as bytl code)
                Invisible Return Parameter (only for procedure dtypes) = r2 -> { proc.r2.lambda double e --> e * 5 } (secretly returns the parameter in addition to the output)



KEYWORDS:
    Loops:
        Toggle, Continue, and Break -> 
            skip <int.usn{# bet 2, array_len} skips = 2> (runs code every other iteration), 
            cont (skips current iteration), 
            br (stops loop)
        For loop: (default for loop is: initial value starts at 0 and goes to another number in increments of 1)
            default for loop -> { for defl var 6 (var) } (for loop from 0 to 6 with variable 'var') 
            customizable for loop = { for $false, !$, x++ (if x > 5 ($true)) } ($ are flags that represent variable placeholders and infer if it is a condition, expression, or assignment based on the context)
            array for loop -> { for:-arr array, index (array[index]) }
        While loop (while something is happening):
            while x (y) (while x is true, run the procedure y)
            elw <condition> (<expression>) (else while)
            welse (<expression>) (else, run a while on the opposite condition)
        Array loop (cycle):
            cycle array use <val element>, <int index>, <arr arrayDuplicate> ()
    Conditional Statements:
        If/Else/Else if statement:
            if <bool condition> (<proc expression>)

            else (<proc expression>)
        Switch statement:

                __ more cases
                def { <proc expression> }
            )
            the 'case' keyword can be used with brackets to specify if a value is greater than (or equal to), less than (or equal to), divisible by, or connected to another variable by using the following syntax:
            gt case <if variable is greater than a value>
            gte case <if variable is greater than or equal to a value>
            lt case <if variable is less than a value>

        System Conditionals:
            sysc <val ~variables> (<alg-arr-bool conditions>)
    Algorithm = alg -> { alg-vect-sc algorithmName sc arg1, sc arg2 (rn args) } (the keyword: 'args' represents all of the arguments in the func)
    Global Variables/Algorithms:
        Event = Event (checks when a variable changes value) -> { Event <val* var val beforeValue val afterValue> .. [var beforeValue afterValue] }
        When = When (similar to 'Event', except checks when a condition becomes true or when an action has happened) -> { When <expr expression> }
        Remove Immute Property (Set mutable) = Mute (sets an immute variable to mutable) -> { Mute <val.immute const> } (where 'const' is an immutable to turn into a mutable)
        Return (in a procedure) = rn -> { alg-int four (rn 4) }
        Typeof (dtype) = Dtype -> { Dtype <val variable> } (where 'variable' is the variable to print the dtype for)
        Typeof (ktype) = Ktype -> { int.cannil.usn var = nil Ktype var } (prints an array of all ktypes i.e. ["CANNIL", "USN"])
        Arguments = Args -> returns an array of all arguments in a algorithm inputted
        Is Nil (Nil Question) = Nilq (checks if value is nil) -> { NilQ <val variable> } (where 'variable' is the variable to nil check)
        Set = Set (used for setting modifiers for all cases) -> { Set <[mod|ktype] modifierOrKtype> } (where 'modifierOrKtype' is the modifier or ktype to set)
        Import/Export = Enable/Ship (can ship out and receive algorithms and variables from one file to another)
        Infer = Infer (all values can be inferred if not specified) -> { Infer __At the start of the file }
        Strictify = Strict (less leeway and more for better practice) -> { Strict __At the start of the file }
        That = That (returns the variable that holds the mainly used parameter) -> { if anArray any e .. e == 5 (That _ index(5)) } (prints the index of 5 in the array, anArray)
        Apply Modifier To = Apply (applies modifiers to specified files) -> Apply <vect-mod modifierList, ~file files> __At the end of the file
        Alias = Alias (gives a variable an alias) -> <val variable> Alias <sc ALIAS> (variable aliases are capitalized for easy recognition)
        Expunge = EPG (completely removes variable from memory) -> EPG variable ('variable' can now be redeclared as a different variable)
        Exit Program = C0 (Stops program at that line of code) -> C0
        Stringify = Soc (Converts literal code value/output into a string) -> arr a = [1 2 3 4]  Soc a (outputs '[1 2 3 4]')
        Create Relative Procedure = Crt (adds a custom procedure to a specified dtype) -> Crt <dtype type> <name> <ambg ~parameters> .. <proc procedure>
        Adjust Relative Procedure = Adj (allows to change source code of existing procedure) -> Adj <;;proc procedure>
        Serialize = Serialize (converts complex object to a portable format) -> Serialize <[assoc|json|rel] object> <bool ^arrOrSc>
    Valid Type Casts (*doesn't work in strict mode):
        SC array (array to string which is the equivalent of array_join nil)
        *ARR string (string to array which is the equivalent of string_split nil)
        *SC number (number to string which converts 9 to "9")
        *CHAR number (number to character which takes the ascii value of the character and returns it)

        *DTYPE string (string to data type (e.g. "int" to int))



MODIFIERS: (   {{ <MODIFIER> }<parameters>}  {{ \<MODIFIER INVERSE> } <parameters> }   ) [ modifiers modify default code ]
    Functional Modifiers (fmod):
        Input:
            {{ glob:res:in MESSAGE } <sc message> } -> (when given the incorrect type in an input, a custom error message will be shown)

    Regular Modifiers:
        Global:
            {{ glob INSTANCESWAP }} -> the default changes from altering a value to returning a value and instance 
            {{ glob ZARGSPARENTHESES }} -> no parentheses are needed for procedures with no arguments (can be called like this -> proc x 'x'    x {{ ZARGSPARENTHESES }})
            {{ glob_Ktype TARGETS }} -> returns an md array instead with both the ktype and the dtypes it targets
            {{ glob_Set APPLYTODEFAULT }} -> applies the modifiers to default bytl variables, algorithms, etc. as well
            {{ glob IGNOREEXCEPTION }} -> instead of throwing an error, faulty code will be skipped/ignored
        Exception:
            {{ glob:exc STACKTRACE }} -> returns a full view on an error instead of a simple one-line sentence
        Array:
            {{ glob:arr_rem MUL }} -> the algorithm called is not removing 2 elements, but instead removing n elements at a position 
            {{ glob:arr_fat EACH }} -> fatten each element as opposed to groups
            {{ glob:arr_index NEGATIVE }} -> gets index in terms of negative value (from right to left)
            {{ glob:arr ARRELEMSINGLE }} -> returns the first element if the array is of length 1
            {{ glob:arr INVERSE }} -> indexing becomes inverted (array[0] gets last element)
        Association:
            {{ glob:assoc NOACCESSDUPE }} -> there cannot be any duplicate accessors in an association
            {{ glob:assoc EXCLUDEACCS }} -> return other possible accessors (if there is more than one)
        Procedure:
            {{ glob:proc UOVD }} -> a procedure that is unoverridable (cannot stop it when its running and cannot alter the procedure after it has been created)
            {{ glob:proc ONCE }} -> a procedure that only runs once, and if called again, holds the value of the first output
        Data Type:
            {{ glob:dtype KTYPEDISABLEDEFAULT }} -> disable default super types for global data types in custom data type
        Kinetic Type:
            {{ glob:ktype:base ALL }} -> all variables are affected no matter which one's value changes in a base kinetype
        String:
            {{ glob:sc_idxo INVERSE }} -> gets index in terms of opposite value (from right to left)
            {{ glob:sc FORMATINVERSE }} -> angle brackets are ok, but a backslash before it expects a template literal
        Context:
            Executable Context:
                {{ glob:;e SIMULATION }} -> simulates possibly harmful cmds instead of running them legitimately



PROCEDURES:
    Boolean Procedures [ where 'boolean' is an example bool ]:
        Compare = compare -> { bool.instance check = boolean : compare<val.cannil item> } (where 'item' is any value and check will be the booleanic comparison between 'boolean' and 'item')


    Number Procedures [ where 'number' is an example num ]:
        To Fixed = fix -> { fpn.instance fixed = number _ fix<int places = math#INF> } (where 'places' is the number of decimal places to fix to defaulting to the max value)
        Truncate (round down) = trunc -> { int.instance truncated = number _ trunc }


    String Procedures [ where 'string' is an example string ]:
        ToCharArray = type cast from string to arr -> { ARR string }
        Select/Slice = sel -> { sc.instance selection = string _ sel<int.?sn start int.?sn end> } (where 'start' and 'end' target create a substring of the original string)
        Includes = inc -> { bool doesInclude = string _ inc<[sc|char|rgx] checker> } (where 'checker' is a substring/regex )
        ToLowerCase = lcase -> { string _ lcase } (converts every character to lowercase if it isn't already)
        ToUpperCase = ucase -> { string _ ucase } (converts every character to uppercase if it isn't already)
        Length = len -> { string _ len } (returns the number of characters in the string)
        Replace = repl -> { string _ repl<[rgx|sc] checker, sc replacer> } (where 'checker' is what to check for and 'replace' is what to replace it with in the string)
        Trim = trim -> { string _ trim<bool ?start bool ?end> } (where 'start' and 'end' are if only you want to trim the beginning or end of the string)
        ASCII = ascii -> { arr asciis = string _ ascii } (returns an array of every character in ascii)
        Index Of = idxo -> { int.usn.cannil ix = string _ idxo<[sc char rgx] checker, int amount = 1> } (where 'checker' is what to look for and 'amount' is the number of indices to return defaulting to 1)
        Split = split -> { arr[sc] splitted = string _ split<[sc|char] splitter> } (where 'splitter' will take every instance of itself and remove it from the string and at each removal a substring from the previous removal (or 0) to the index of the removal will be added to a returned array)
        Join = join -> { array _ join<sc joiner> } (will create an array with a separator of 'joiner')
        Repeat = rep -> { string _ rep<int.usn amount> } (where 'amount' is the number of times to repeat the string)
        Occurences = occur -> { string _ occur<[rgx|sc|char] checker int ?limit> } (where 'checker' is the occurence checker and 'limit' is the max occurence count to be returned)


    Array Procedures [ where 'array' is an example array ] (you can either use full keyword method or bracket method):
        Index Of = index -> { int e = array _ index<val element int ?times = 1> } (where 'element' is the item to check for its index and 'times' is for how many indexes to return)
        Length = length -> { int l = array _ length } (returns number of elements in array)
        Push = ins -> { array _ ins<int position = (array_length - 1) val ~items> } (where position is the index to push (default is end of array) and items is the list of items to insert)
        Pop = rem -> { array _ rem<val ~items> } OR { array_rem<int position, int amount> {{ MUL }} } (where position is index in the array and amount is the number of items to remove at that index; the 'mul' specifier is specifying multiple removals for the context )
        Sort = sort -> { array _ sort<sc format> } (where 'format' is matched by a specific regex such as "a-z")
        Reverse = rev -> { array _ rev }
        Select/Slice = select -> { collection sliced = array _ select<int start int amount> } (where 'start' is the start of slice (index base 0) and 'amount' is the places in the array to slice)
        Includes = has -> { bool check = array _ has<val element> } (where 'element' is any value that you would want to check for in an array)
        Flatten = flat -> { array _ flat<int ?amount> } (will flatten any 2d+ array to a 1d array unless otherwise specified by a depth argument, 'amount')
        Fatten = fat -> { array _ fat<int amount> } (where 'amount' specifies how many extra layers of array e.g. [1 2 3]:fat(1) would give [[1 2 3]] and [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] would give [[[1 2 3]] [[4 5 6]] [[7 8 9]]])
        Sum = sum (only for num arrays) -> { num sum = array _ sum } (returns the sum of all numeric values in an array)
        Series = serie (only for sequences) -> { num sum = seq _ serie<int last> } (where 'last' is the place of the seq to sum up to i.e. {1 3 5}:serie(2) will return 1 + 3 because the last value is 2)
        Shuffle = shuf -> { arr.instance shuffled = array _ shuf }


    Regex Procedures [ where 'regex' is an example regex ]:
        

    Ambiguous Procedures [ where 'ambiguous' is an example ambiguous ]:
        Data Type History = dtypeHist -> { ambiguous variable = 'a'   variable = "hello"   variable = 2.2   variable _ dtypeHist }



MISCELLANEOUS:
    Difference between 'ambiguous' and 'val'? ambigious can change data types while val cannot
    Do commas have a use? JSON variables and parameter filters, otherwise separation is by using blocks
    Special (Curly) blocks uses:
        Parameter Filters (also works on orps) -> proc procedure = sc.?cannil{_len > 6, _occur "string" > 2, # !== "nope"} string (...) (will only allow string parameters with len > 6 and at least 2 occurences of "string", and self is not "nope")
        JSON -> JSON json = [{...}, {...}, ...]
    Cool assignments:
        'int x = 3  x *+= 2, 4' (x is now 10)
        'int y = 5  y ^-%/= 2, 5, 7, 6' (y is now 1)
        'val z _= 7 algo' (z is now equal to 'algo z')
    Printing in Bytl is just putting an expression or using >>:
        '5' prints 5
        'int.usn x = 10    Ktype x' prints "usn"
        '>> 5' prints 5
    Precedence:
        ( inferior precedence } (will run last)
            e.g. if ( x == 5 } & !x#key (...) (the second statement will run before the first statement)
        { superior precedence ) (will run first)
            e.g. if bet x_p 1, 3 | { apply x#check ) (...) the second statement will run before the first statement
        [ within math context ] ( superior precedence )
            e.g. >> ;m 2^7π * (5 + 2); (within brackets run first due to BEDMAS)
    Special Contexts: (chainable like this ;bm ... ; (runs both bit and math contexts))
        Bit-context -> ;b 3 >> 4 ~ 2 - 4 & 1 ; (example bit operations)
        Regex-context -> ;r ^[^not]\d+$ ; (example regex)
        Executable-context -> ;e cd ~, ls ; (example terminal commands (commas and newlines separate commands))
        Mathematical-context -> ;m 3! * 7% ∑(n1,10,n) ; (mathematical operators such as factorial, and sigma sum are now executable)
        Source-context -> ;s Crt int  ; (can alter source code)
        Path-context -> ;p ../path/to/file ;
    Relative Creation Syntax (indents are not required, but make it more readable):
        :: <relative name>
            : <create sub relative> ; __ (can infinitely nest relatives)
            _ <create procedure for relative>
            # <create value for relative>
        :: {{ TYPE }}
        Specifiying the 'TYPE' modifier turns the relative into a datatype, without it, the relative would just be for organization
    Modifier Precedence:
        { expression } ... {{ MODIFIER }} (anything in curly blocks will be affected by the modifier, nothing else will be)
            (no curly blocks means every possible modification will be made)
    'if .. eif .. else' as ternary:
        Regular -> if c1 ( rn a ) eif c2 ( rn b ) else ( rn c )
        As Ternary -> rn c1 ? a || c2 ? b : c
        '||' represents eif
    Every type classified (applies to subtypes):
        dtype -> 'data type' | representation of all types (excluding 'ktype') | examples: 'int', 'rgx', 'assoc'
        ftype -> 'functional type' | cannot create a variable from (only used for functionality) | examples: 'math', 'time', 'rnd'
        ktype -> 'kinetic type' | modifies variable value | examples: 'dync', 'immute', 'usn'
        gtype -> 'ghost type' | types that can only be referenced, not used | examples: 'dtype', 'rel', 'gtype'
        rtype -> 'reference type' | types that reference primitives | examples: 'rgx', 'exc'
        ptype -> 'primitive type' | original bytl types | examples: 'assoc', 'int', 'bool'
        etype -> 'encapsulating type' | takes in types 
        stype -> 'special type' | none of the above | examples: 'cmacro', 'comm', 'mod'
    Every bracket classified:
        ( ... ) -> default block:
            code blocks - 'if someCondition ( !@ code to run @! )'
            separation - 'vect[int] v = [1 2 ( !@ some expression that returns an int @! ) 4 5]'
            readability (escaped) - 'while variable bet \( !@ put code as normal @! ) ...' (prevents ambiguity)
        [ ... ] -> square block:
            indexing - '>> anArray[!@ array index @!]'

        { ... ) -> inferior precedence block:

        < ... > -> angle block:
